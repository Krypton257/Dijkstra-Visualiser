# Dijkstra-Visualiser
A visualiser for the DIJKSTRA algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
Some nodes can be converted to walls to restrict the use of those nodes at the time of traversal.
Built a webpage for the same using the React framework and JavaScript programming language.
